Estimating Integrals by Using Monte Carlo Simulations. 
Explored the application of Monte Carlo simulations to estimate integrals, employing random sampling to approximate complex integrals. 
Investigated the sample mean Monte Carlo method, utilizing statistical sampling techniques to compute the average value of a function and estimate integrals
Examined the success and failure Monte Carlo method, estimating integrals by sampling random numbers and measuring the ratio of successful samples to total trials.
Implemented the success and failure Monte Carlo method in Python for estimating integrals.
